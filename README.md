-  Hi 👋 I’m @Sid-the-Slothh
- I’m interested in all sorts of programming concepts. Right now, I am looking into basic math-less encryption and learning about using math concepts for more 
robust encryption. I will look into more interesting and advanced concepts once I have my basics down.
- I’m currently learning python and C++
-  I’m not currently looking to collaborate, but any feedback on posted projects would be valued 
- How to reach me : Discord: Sid #2281
